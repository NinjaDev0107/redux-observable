README: If this is a *usage question*, please **do not post it here**, post it on Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux-observable) first; if you get no response after a reasonable amount of time, create a ticket here and link us to your Stack Overflow question. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question.

We also have a Gitter channel anyone is welcome to join to discuss anything and find help: https://gitter.im/redux-observable/redux-observable

Most questions are not actually redux-observable specific, but rather general RxJS questions and patterns. RxJS bugs can be reported in their repo: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs
