### RxJS operators are missing! e.g. TypeError: action$.ofType(...).switchMap is not a function

RxJS supports the ability to [add operators individually](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs#installation-and-usage) so your bundles remain small. redux-observable honors this by having the `ActionsObservable` extend `Observable` but otherwise not adding any of the core operators to the prototype.

#### Add all operators

If you want to instead add all operators, you can import the entire library inside your entry `index.js`:

```js
import 'rxjs';
```
This will add every core RxJS operator to the `Observable` prototype.

#### Add only the operators you use

tl;dr


```js
import 'rxjs/add/operator/switchMap';
action$.ofType(...).switchMap(...);

// OR

import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operator/switchMap';
action$.ofType(...)::switchMap(...);
```

There are several ways to do this, so we don't suggest any particular one in the docs. Check out the [RxJS documentation on this](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs#installation-and-usage).

If you use the `'rxjs/add/operator/name'` technique, you may find it helpful to create a single file where you place all of these so you don't have to import the same operators repeatedly.

### TypeError: object is not observable

This almost always means somewhere you're passing an object to an RxJS operator that isn't observable-like. That means it's not an Observable, Promise, Array, doesn't support `Symbol.observable`, etc.

The following are some examples of that.

#### (action$, store) => Observable.from(store)

The store provided to your Epics is the same one provided by redux to the middleware. It is not a full version of the store, so it does not support the `Symbol.observable` interop point to allow `Observable.from(store)`. You can [learn more about this here](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/56).

### TypeError: Cannot read property 'subscribe' of undefined

This almost always means you're using an operator somewhere that expects to be provided with an observable but you instead did not give it anything at all. Often, you may be passing a variable but it is unknowingly set to `undefined`, so step through a debugger to confirm.

#### Happens from `combineEpics()`

Usually this means you're not returning an observable from one or more of your Epics. Often this is just a missing `return`.

```js
const myEpic = action$ => { // MISSING EXPLICIT RETURN!
  action$.ofType(...).etc(...)
};
```

### this is set to Window

If you are organizing your epics into a class. (E.g. in order to benefit from Angular 2 dependency injection), you might have made the mistake of using class methods:

```typescript
class TooFancy {
  constructor(private somethingInjected:SomethingInjected)
  checkAutoLogin (action$: Observable<IPayloadAction>) {
    console.log(this); // Is Window! when called from redux-observable
  }
}
```
follow the docs and:

```typescript
class TooFancy {
  constructor(private somethingInjected:SomethingInjected)
  checkAutoLogin =  (action$: Observable<IPayloadAction>) => {
    console.log(this); // YOu can access somethingInjected
  }
}
```

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions (Arrow functions used as methods)

### It seems like your epics are not responding to actions

You might be returning the result of calling `subscribe` on an `Observable` from one of your epics.

```js
const myEpic = action$ => {
  return action$.ofType(...)
  // performing side effect with .subscribe!
  .subscribe(item => console.log(item));
};
```

The problem with this is that calling `subscribe` on an `Observable` does not return another `Observable`.
All epics should return an `Observable`.
If you ran into this issue and want to learn more about it, read through this issue: https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable/issues/263.

If you want your epic to be "read-only", meaning you want it to perform side-effects
without producing any downstream actions, you can use the following pattern.

```js
const myEpic = action$ => {
  return action$.ofType(...)
  .map(...)
  .do(item => console.log(item))
  .ignoreElements();
};
```

This approach essentially returns an empty `Observable` from the epic, which does not cause any downstream actions.

### Typescript: ofType operator won't narrow to proper Observable type

Let's say you have following action types + action creator types:

```ts
import { Action } from 'redux'

const enum ActionTypes {
  One = 'ACTION_ONE',
  Two = 'ACTION_TWO',
}
const doOne = (myStr: string): One => ({type: ActionTypes.One, myStr})
const doTwo = (myBool: boolean): Two => ({type: ActionTypes.Two, myBool})

interface One extends Action {
  type: ActionTypes.One
  myStr: string
}
interface Two extends Action {
  type: ActionTypes.Two
  myBool: boolean
}
type Actions = One | Two
```

When you're using `.ofType` operator for filtering, returned observable won't be correctly narrowed within Type System, because its not capable of doing so yet ( TS 2.6.2 ).

To fix this, you need to explicitly set the generic type, so Typescript understands your intent, and narrows your action stream correctly:

```ts
// This will let action be `Actions` type, which is wrong
const epic = (action$: ActionsObservable<Actions>) =>
  action$
    .ofType(ActionTypes.One)
    // action is still type Actions instead of One
    .map((action) => {...})

// Explicitly set generics fixes the issue
const epic = (action$: ActionsObservable<Actions>) =>
  action$
    .ofType<One>(ActionTypes.One)
    // action is correctly narrowed to One
    .map((action) => {...})
```

Similar issue exists when pipeable operators are used ( Rx >=5.5  ).

Again fix is similar by provide explicitly generics
> this time you need to provide both while epic stream + narrowed type

```ts
// With pipeable operator, ofType won't narrow correctly
const epic = (action$: ActionsObservable<Actions>) =>
  action$.pipe(
    ofType(ActionTypes.One),
    // action is still type Actions instead of One
    map((action) => {...})
  )

// Explicitly set generics fixes the issue
const epic = (action$: ActionsObservable<Actions>) =>
  action$.pipe(
    ofType<Actions,One>(ActionTypes.One),
    // action is correctly narrowed to One
    map((action) => {...})
  )
```
